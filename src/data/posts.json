      "rendered": "<p>Today was a long day, but we&#8217;ve made it! The house is complete, we have paid the final invoice to Viebrockhaus and the house has been formally handed over to us.</p>\n<p>We arrived at around 7.30am, just as the painters were leaving, having touched up all of the places we had marked for re-working.</p>\n<p>The guy who had previously been there to put silicone sealant in the bathrooms was also there, and had already\u00a0done a couple of improvements and the work that hadn&#8217;t been done last week in the guest WC. He had to come back anyway, to fit and seal the Viebrockhaus Cornerstone, with the precise coordinates of our house on.</p>\n<p><img class=\"my-2\" src=\"../images/2017/04/IMG_3454-Edit-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"    /><br />\n<img class=\"my-2\" src=\"../images/2017/04/IMG_3471-Edit-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"    /></p>\n<p>Around the same time, someone from the\u00a0heating / plumbing company turned up to check the heating, which fortunately has been running without any alarms since the electrician let the water out yesterday. He said that the alarms would certainly have been caused by the flooding to the inside of the heat pump, but it will\u00a0not have done any harm.</p>\n<p>Our new shower\u00a0tap (the correct one) hasn&#8217;t arrived yet, so they will call us to make an appointment to come and change it when it does arrive.</p>\n<p>The construction manager then arrived and we went through the open issues list we&#8217;d made last week, mainly crossing off the things that had meanwhile been completed, and adding some new ones.</p>\n<p>The issue with the water being stuck in the cellar window light shafts was easily solved by the construction manager unscrewing the vents which seemed to be blocked &#8211; as soon as he did, we could hear the water running away. We will need to keep an eye on these and if necessary take them completely out and clean them, but it was nothing serious in the end.</p>\n<p>After some formalities, the construction manager then handed over the\u00a0certificate which states for the next 50 years, a specific 150 sq. meters of rain forest in Bocas del Toro, Panama will be protected in our name. This is to offset the CO2 emissions caused by the construction of the house, effectively\u00a0making it carbon-neutral. We might visit sometime if we are passing on a cruise ship!</p>\n<p><img class=\"my-2\" src=\"../images/2017/04/IMG_3478-Edit-618x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"    /></p>\n<p>We also received two small gifts from Viebrockhaus, a tree to plant in the garden and a set of scissors.</p>\n<p><img class=\"my-2\" src=\"../images/2017/04/IMG_3477-576x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"    /> <img class=\"my-2\" src=\"../images/2017/04/IMG_3475-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"    /></p>\n<p>The window company had been\u00a0expected to show up at 9am but apparently were stuck in snow and finally turned up at 4pm. We did have a couple of snow flurries today, but not enough to hold you up that long. We&#8217;re not sure what happened, but as we were planning to be at the house all day it didn&#8217;t matter.

Ideally, these will all be\u00a0resolved by next Wednesday when we have the final handover meeting, but because of Easter, it could be that some of these will take longer (time will tell how much longer) as there are only two more working days until then!</p>\n<p>Some of these\u00a0have already been addressed during the day &#8211; the interior door installer turned up\u00a0for a few minutes to fix a small broken off corner of one of the doors and the staircase installer turned up to touch up the paintwork.</p>\n<p>Only two slightly more serious points remain open &#8211;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the electric shutters are not in-service yet and are currently half closed</li>\n<li>the satellite dish is not correctly aligned.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We made it very clear that we will pay the final invoice in full, only when these points have been addressed, which the construction manager seemed to accept.

Hopefully, the thought of not getting paid for what has not been delivered yet will help with ensuring the correct priority!</p>\n<p>On the whole, we are extremely happy with the house at this point, almost all of the contractors have been really great and Viebrockhaus have kept to their commitment with the timeline. Reading some other peoples&#8217;\u00a0blogs, we can be happy that we built with Viebrockhaus and that nothing really went wrong along the way.</p>\n<p>The initial cleaning, which was done yesterday, surpassed our expectations and the windows are really sparkling, there is no more dust everywhere (nor pieces of plaster, cement etc.), but over the (long) weekend, we will clean the house some more (and we still have a lot of packing to do, ahead of moving in about 12 days time!)</p>\n",

This is in part because we have a cellar, and in part because we have bricks on the outside, whereas the others will be rendered.</p>\n<p>Since the really exciting day when the roof and the solar panels were installed back on 21st December, the following has happened:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ceiling support jacks that were supporting the ground floor ceiling / upstairs floor have been removed as the concrete has now had well over a month to\u00a0dry</li>\n<li>The soffit boards have been installed, so now there is no huge gap under the eaves</li>\n<li>The fence that was surrounding the site (which was only there because of the excavation for the cellar) has been removed</li>\n<li>A storm blew over the sign and some toilets, most of which have been put upright again</li>\n<li>We have been waiting for the scaffolding to be taken down so that we can get a good look at the house for the first time, but it hasn&#8217;t gone yet!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As frustrating as it is for us to have to wait so long for any progress (especially after the daily dramatic progress during November and December), it was planned that way.</p>\n<p>Other than the scaffolding not being removed the only things planned for Week 1-4 of 2017 were the installation of the French Balconies (it is written in the plan that these can be installed anytime between January and April) and cleaning of the brickwork (which will be done at the same time as pointing the brickwork, for which it is currently too cold). Neither of these outside jobs is (or will) hold-up the work inside.</p>\n<p>Starting next week, however, we do expect to see some progress again. Over the next two weeks (30th January to 12th February):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The roof insulation should be installed</li>\n<li>The dry walls should be built</li>\n<li>The electrical installation should begin</li>\n<li>The plumbing\u00a0installation should begin</li>\n<li>The bathroom installation should be partly done (bath and shower tray)</li>\n<li>The heating system should be installed (boiler and underfloor pipes)</li>\n<li>The\u00a0floor should be filled in (screed) to a depth of 18cm downstairs and 16cm upstairs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pictures will follow of course.</p>\n<h2>Upstairs Flooring</h2>\n<p>At the weekend we are off to choose a new floor covering for upstairs. We found out yesterday that the one we chose previously (click-vinyl) has strangely disappeared without a trace from the internet, and seems not to be available any longer. We are not sure why, but if there is a problem with it, we are happy to have found out sooner rather than later!</p>\n",

It looks like that house\u00a0(which is being built by a different builder) is going to be going up at the same time too.</p>\n<p>After that, we went to the DIY store to look again at click-vinyl flooring. The in-store expert from <a href=\"http://www.logoclic.info/en/designer-flooring-aqua-splash1\">Logoclic</a>\u00a0was really\u00a0helpful and answered all of our questions about the Aqua Splash range, which we had seen for the first time last week.</p>\n<p>Even though we are not going to put it into the bathroom, we want to have something waterproof so that we can clean it with our steam cleaner (I almost wrote &#8216;pressure washer&#8217; by mistake &#8211; no it doesn&#8217;t need to be that waterproof!).</p>\n<p>We already had some samples which we brought home\u00a0last week, but a new colour had just arrived so we forked out for the \u20ac3 deposit so that we could bring the new one home too. We now have samples the four colours shown in the picture above at home.</p>\n<p>After looking at them in both daylight and also with lights on this evening, we have decided on &#8216;Stratford&#8217; (top left).</p>\n<p>Next job: take the other samples back and collect \u20ac9!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

When we arrived at the plot, the four corners of our house had already been marked out with wooden posts (as well as the houses of two\u00a0neighbours).</p>\n<p>Now those posts are there we can see where the back of the house will be, and where the terrace will be. This means that we are now able to visualise the size of the garden much more easily. (It is more than big enough for us, at roughly 11 meters long x 15 meters wide).</p>\n<p>Mr H then introduced himself and told us a little bit about himself. He will be our Construction Manager for the entire build (not just for the structural build phase, as we had first thought).</p>\n<p>We are pleased to say that he comes across as very knowledgeable and friendly. From now on he will be our single point of contact at Viebrockhaus, and is available to be called / e-mailed any time in case we have any questions, and promises that he will get back to us the same day (or latest the next day if we call too late!)</p>\n<p>We\u00a0went through various details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for the groundwork and electricity, water and telephone connections</li>\n<li>the height (above sea level) that the ground floor will be built</li>\n<li>how the construction site will be laid out (where they will put various containers and a silo).</li>\n<li>including a couple things we are going to do ourselves before the handover into the plan (upstairs flooring and loft flooring)</li>\n<li>a rough timeline for the structural build &#8211; assuming that they will start in the next two or three weeks as planned, they aim to get it water tight (roof on and windows in) before the Christmas holiday.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again we are surprised &#8211; we had expected that they would only build the cellar this year, and only start with the work above ground in January. In theory, this should mean that they are also finished earlier (and we can move in earlier), but we will not get a detailed timeline until the roof is on, at which point the weather becomes less of a consideration. At that point, they will commit to a handover date (and\u00a0from reading other people&#8217;s blogs, Viebrockhaus keeps to this commitment).</p>\n<p>As we shook hands and said goodbye to Mr H, he handed over our time-capsule (which will be built into the brickwork at the topping out ceremony), and our builders hard hats. All we need now are\u00a0hi-vis jackets (actually it is the law to have these in cars in Germany, so we can use the ones we already have!).</p>\n<p><img class=\"my-2\" src=\"../images/2016/10/P1000975-Edit-237x300.jpg\" alt=\"p1000975-edit\" width=\"100%\"    /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We then went to have another walk around the garden before we left, and while there,\u00a0were asked by a couple of passers-by (and their small Jack Russell) if we were the owners of that plot. When we said yes, they\u00a0introduced themselves as our new next-door neighbours! It was nice to meet them and exchange telephone numbers.\u00a0Their build should be started at more or less exactly the same time.</p>\n<p>Now we (and also our new neighbours) are just waiting on the planning approval and the transfer of the land. Hopefully, it will all fall into place with no unexpected delays.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

After bringing us a coffee, we were made a start!</p>\n<p>We had been told in advance, that the meeting would last around five hours, but as\u00a0we were very well prepared (and had already\u00a0made decisions about many of the things), had expected it would not last that\u00a0long.</p>\n<p>The first thing we did was to go over the minor corrections to the plan that we had identified last week (the main one being the 15cm repositioning of the utility room internal door). These are now all marked on the plan with a red pen. Hopefully, the next printed version of the plan will be completely correct.</p>\n<p>Next, we started our tour through the exhibition, deciding and documenting on all the fine details. After this, any further changes might not be free (as Viebrockhaus will start ordering the materials), so on some topics, we took some time to consider and try to make the decision that will be happy with for years to come.</p>\n<p>For the topics where we had already made a decision back in August, it was just a case of Mr G writing them down.</p>\n<p>In the end, the meeting lasted 4.5 hours.\u00a0We have to wonder how long other people that haven&#8217;t put in as much preparation as us would need (keep in mind we had already been through the exhibition in August &#8211; some people are probably there for the first time at this meeting).</p>\n<p>The following things are now cast in stone&#8230;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The direction\u00a0that each\u00a0door\u00a0and window will open</li>\n<li>The colour of the&#8230;\n<ul>\n<li>bricks &#8211; as written some weeks ago Roeben Accum Blue-Brown</li>\n<li>cement (standard grey 1.5)</li>\n<li>roof tiles (black, to match the solar panels)</li>\n<li>stairs (anthracite)</li>\n<li>air vents (dark brown)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The flooring\n<ul>\n<li>Villeroy &amp;\u00a0Boch &#8216;Lodge&#8217; in Greige for almost all of the ground floor</li>\n<li>Villeroy &amp;\u00a0Boch &#8216;Upper Side&#8217; in Anthracite for the utility\u00a0room</li>\n<li>Villeroy &amp; Boch &#8216;Bernina&#8217; Greige Matt for the bathroom</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The bathroom (and the downstairs loo)\n<ul>\n<li>Toilets (Villeroy &amp;\u00a0Boch &#8216;Avento&#8217; Direct Flush)</li>\n<li>Sink (Villeroy &amp;\u00a0Boch &#8216;Avento&#8217; &#8211; 60cm wide upstairs / 45cm downstairs)</li>\n<li>Bath (Villeroy &amp;\u00a0Boch &#8216;O.novo&#8217; Rectangular)</li>\n<li>Shower tray (Villeroy &amp; Boch Architectura Metal Rim 120cm x 90cm)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The doors, inside and out</li>\n<li>And then a lot of very small but important things\n<ul>\n<li>The shape of the skirting boards</li>\n<li>The colour of the roller shutters</li>\n<li>The design of the light switches and sockets</li>\n<li>Which door handles</li>\n<li>Which taps and shower head</li>\n<li>The height of the toilets / sinks</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to Mr G&#8217;s expertise, methodical approach and patience, it was a very enjoyable day, and we are very happy that Viebrockhaus can now proceed to order the materials to build our house.

We now have a copy of the 16-page survey report which seems to go into a lot of detail.</p>\n<p>The price (which is a fixed price) came in a couple of thousand Euros above the latest estimate, but a couple of thousand Euros below the original estimate\u00a0we had received.

Since it is below the original offer, we will not\u00a0get another offer from a third party, which could only serve to delay the start and risk complicating the warranty for the house.</p>\n<p>We then proceeded to go through the plans for the cellar, ground floor and first floor, incorporating a few more\u00a0minor changes which hadn&#8217;t already been added to the plan, and shifting the house left and right a few centimetres into the exact place we want it.</p>\n<p>The plans are now locked in, and the paperwork for the planning approval is now being done.</p>\n<p style=\"font: 10px arial, sans-serif;\">Picture credit: <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/en/building-joy-planning-plans-1080592/\">pixabay.com</a></p>\n",

    "content": {
      "rendered": "<p>Quite a\u00a0few updates over the last two days, so we have split this update into four sections&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Kitchen Planning</h3>\n<p>Yesterday morning, we made some further progress\u00a0with the kitchen planning, making\u00a0a new mock-up in\u00a0the online planning tool. We have now added wall cupboards all the way around as we worked out that the vent in the ceiling\u00a0does not prevent us doing so.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With a print out in our hands, we\u00a0then went and had a great discussion with a kitchen consultant at a local furniture store, who kindly made a draft version within his planning software\u00a0and gave us an approximate price for the cabinets, electrical devices and installation.</p>\n<p>The price for the cabinets as well as the hob, oven, dishwasher, fridge/freezer and installation were roughly\u00a0in line with our expectations (only a little bit higher, but you can always spend more than you first want to!)</p>\n<p>The only item, where we may have underestimated, was the cooker hood.</p>\n<p>Because of the energy efficient construction of the house, we need to have an air circulation hood (which puts the filtered air back into the house) rather than a traditional extractor hood (which puts the air through the wall and\u00a0outside).</p>\n<p>We learned that there are two types of air circulation hoods available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>one where you need to buy and change the filter every few months</li>\n<li>one where\u00a0you don&#8217;t have to change the filter (for 10 years or more) which works by filtering the air and then splitting the remaining molecules with a plasma catalyser so that only oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapour remain and get\u00a0put back into the room (see <a href=\"http://www.interflow.co.uk/manufacturers/plasmanorm/\">here</a> for a more technical / accurate description of how it works.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second option has (of course) a much higher initial cost but\u00a0this should be recovered over time by not having to buy filters, and the overall air quality of what is put into the room should be better.\u00a0We will probably go for this but haven&#8217;t finally decided. Maybe it depends on the groundwork costs, which we (frustratingly) are still waiting for.</p>\n<p>Since we need to have the plans for the kitchen finalised quite soon (so that Viebrockhaus know where to put the water and electrical installations) we have made an appointment for 8th October to go back to work out the final details for the kitchen and\u00a0to place an order.</p>\n<h3>Draft Contract for the Plot</h3>\n<p>Today we finally received the draft contract for the purchase of the plot which we have been waiting for for a while now. We have one or two small questions but in general, everything seems to be in order and as expected.\u00a0Our\u00a0meeting with the notary for the formal reading and signing of the contract is now confirmed for next Monday.</p>\n<h3>Mortgage</h3>\n<p>Also today, we had another short meeting\u00a0with the bank to hand over the KFW 40 paperwork (which confirms the Energy Efficient Construction and\u00a0eligibility for the reduced interest rate and \u20ac10,000 bonus) as well as the construction specification from Viebrockhaus. Everything is now in place and the mortgage contract can now be prepared.</p>\n<h3>Updated Draft Plan</h3>\n<p>Later, during the afternoon, we received the latest version of the draft plan from Viebrockhaus, and have checked it\u00a0this evening. There are a few small mistakes which still need to be corrected during our &#8216;Service Meeting&#8217; next week, mainly caused by changes that we had earlier made and then unmade not having been completely reset.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The utility room and downstairs WC are\u00a0slightly the wrong shape and size now, caused by us having previously added a shower in the downstairs WC and later removing it.</li>\n<li>One of the cellar window grates is directly under the utility room door, which is not where we originally had drawn it &#8211; at the moment is not clear whether this is intentional or not (it may be actually a good place to have it). We have made a note to check this</li>\n<li>The carport is still drawn in the wrong place &#8211; actually where it is drawn is outside of the area it is allowed to go (as it cannot be more than 15 meters from the boundary). We need to make sure that this is correct on the planning permission request so that we don&#8217;t cause any delays.)</li>\n<li>The outside tap has jumped from the sidewall (behind where our fence/gate will originally go) to the front wall. This may be unavoidable &#8211; we read somewhere that for hygiene reasons it is not allowed to the last tap on the pipe &#8211; in which case maybe it makes sense to have it at the front. We will just need to find a way to ensure that no-one steals our water!</li>\n<li>The bathroom layout (Shower and wash basin) needs to be reset to the original plan as we have now decided NOT to have the L-shaped wall for the walk-in shower, and to revert to having glass shower walls. When we looked at the 3D model\u00a0provided by Viebrockaus we realised that the L-shaped wall would block most of the light out from the bathroom (which we might not like)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our adviser at Viebrockhaus continues to be very helpful\u00a0and\u00a0patient with all of our changes and un-changes, and we are now very close to being done with the plan, ready for the planning permission paperwork.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, the groundwork costs will be here soon&#8230;</p>\n",
